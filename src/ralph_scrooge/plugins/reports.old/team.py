"""
Plugin for billing teams on pricing report.

There are 5 possible models of team billing:
- time
- devices-cores
- devices
- distribution
- average

* Time
For each team, that should be billed based on time model, should be provided
information about percentage division of time, that team spent for each
venture (in some period of time - generally this periods don't have to be the
same as team cost period). It's assumed, that team cost, that is defined for
some period of time, is split between all days in period as some daily cost
and then distributed between teams based on their value of time spent.

* Devices-cores
In this billing model, each venture is billed for total number of owned devices
and cores, proportionally to total number of devices and cores for all
ventures (in period of team cost definition). Having such proportions, half of
team cost in period of time is designed for devices and other half for cores.
Devices and cores "budget" is distributed for each venture, proportionally to
the number of owned devices and cores.

* Devices
This billing model is similar to devices-cores model, but whole team cost is
distributed to ventures proprotionally to the number of devices each own.

* Distribution
This model is using other teams (not-distributed) and information about team
members count (more specifically: proportion of team members number to total
members number of all teams). Cost of distributed team is split between all
other teams based on members number proportion. Then, based on other team
model (time, devices-cores or devices), team cost (which is part of total
distributed cost) is spliited between all ventures and summed with parts of
cost for other teams.

* Average
This model is using other teams and use average of percent of other teams costs
distribution between ventures.
