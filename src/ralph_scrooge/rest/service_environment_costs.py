    their `value` and `cost` fields) per period given by `group_by` (e.g.
    "day" or "month").

    The result of such single summarization looks like this:

        {
            "grouped_date": "2016-10",  # or "2016-10-01" when group by day
            "total_cost": 1400.00,
            "usages": {
                "some_type1": {
                    "cost": 50.00,
                    "usage_value": 10.00,
                    "subcosts": {}
                },
                "some_type2": {
                    "cost": 300.0,
                    "usage_value": 0.0
                    "subcosts": {
                        # we assume that only one level of nesting is possible
                        # here (i.e., that there are no sub-subcosts)
                        "some_type3": {
                            "cost": 100.00,
                            "usage_value": 10.00
                        },
                        "some_type4": {
                            "cost": 200.00,
                            "usage_value": 20.10
                        }
                    }
                }
                ...
            }
        }

    Such results are collected into a list, and that list is wrapped
    into a dict, under the `service-environment-costs` key - and that
    dict is returned as a final result.

    And while the aforementioned costs are summarized only for selected usage
    types, the value in `total_cost` field contains sum of costs associated
    with *all* usage types for a given service environment / date range
    combination - so if there are no such "other" costs, this value should be
    equal to the sum of `cost` fields above.

    It is also worth mentioning, that precision of fields `total_cost`, `cost`
    and `usage_values` is controlled by `USAGE_COST_NUM_DIGITS` and
    `USAGE_VALUE_NUM_DIGITS` defined in this module.
