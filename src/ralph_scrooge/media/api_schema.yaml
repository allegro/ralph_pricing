# REMEMBER that everytime you change anything here, you should use Scrooge's
# management command `scrooge generate_json_schema`!
#
# This step is required because swagger-ui can consume schema given as YAML, but
# that doesn't have to be the case with other clients, so it's better to serve
# it as JSON, and treat this file only as a source file for editing.
#
# It may also be a good idea to validate this file with http://editor.swagger.io
# when you finish editing it.

swagger: '2.0'

# TODO(xor-xor): Divide this schema into two separate files - for v0.9 and
# v0.10, respectively - because now this `version` field is pretty useless.

        of your requests has to contain ``Authorization`` header in the
        following format: ``Authorization: Token your_api_key``. You can fetch
        your API key here, by POST-ing your credentials (assuming that you

        Since this endpoint is rather complex, it needs some additional
        comments. The expected data structure looks as follows:
        ```
        {
            "pricing_service": "<pricing service name or ID>",
            "date": "<date>",
            ["overwrite: "no | values_only | delete_all_previous"],
            ["ignore_unknown_services": "true | false"],
            "usages": [
                {
                    "pricing_object": "<pricing_object_name>" |
                    (
                        ("service": "<service name>" | "service_id": <service ID (in Scrooge)> | "service_uid": "<service UID>"),
                        "environment": "<environment name>",
                    )
                    "usages": [
                        {
                            "symbol": "<usage type symbol>",
                            "value": <actual usage without units>,
                            "remarks": <your remarks (this field is optional)>
                        },
                        ...
                    ]
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
        ```
        As you can see, ``overwrite`` and ``ignore_unknown_services`` fields are
        optional - their default value are ``no`` and ``false`` respectively
        (see below for the description of all of their values).

        You can provide here either service being charged (given either by its
        name, ID or UID), which will be charged directly, or the pricing object
        (e.g. hostname or IP address) - the service assigned to this pricing
        object will be charged implicitly. In the former case (i.e., providing
        service instead of pricing object), you need to specify the name of the
        environment as well. You can mix all those three forms in a single
        request, as shown in the example below, but the preferred form is by
        specifying pricing object.

        Please note that in case of uploading your data via pricing object
        (instead of service and environment, see expected data structure above),
        its service environment is implicitly given.

        You could use field ``ignore_unknown_services`` to handle the case, when
        incoming data might be invalid, ex. some of provided service-environment
        does not exist. By default (or when this field is set to ``false``) this
        will result in ``400`` error. When you set it to ``true``, all invalid
        rows will be ignored and their values will not be saved.

        The aforementioned ``overwrite`` field defines a way how to treat
        previous service usage values uploaded for the same date and usage
        type. There are three possible actions here:

        * ``delete_all_previous`` - all previously uploaded daily usages for
        the same date, with the same usage type should be deleted - only
        usages from the 2nd upload should remain, despite the fact that 1st
        upload contained daily usage for different service environment than
        the 2nd one. Example:
            * __1st upload__ (same day, same usage type):
              daily usage 1: service env 1, value 40;
              daily usage 2: service env 2, value 60
            * __2nd upload__ (same day, same usage type):
              daily usage 1: service env 1, value 50
            * __final result__:
              daily usage 1: service env 1, value 50

        * ``values_only`` - all previously uploaded daily usages from the same
        date, with the same usage type __and the same service environment__
        (or pricing object - see remark at the bottom of this section)
        should be replaced by the new daily usage - the ones with different
        service environment should remain untouched. Example:
            * __1st upload__ (same day, same usage type):
              daily usage 1: service env 1, value 40
              daily usage 2: service env 2, value 60
            * __2nd upload__ (same day, same usage type):
              daily usage 1: service env 1, value 50
            * __final result__:
              daily usage 1: service env 2, value 60
              daily usage 2: service env 1, value 50

        * ``no`` - nothing gets deleted/replaced, new daily usages should be
        added to the existing ones, despite the fact that it has the same
        service environment as the one from the previous upload. Example:
            * __1st upload__ (same day, same usage type):
              daily usage 1: service env 1, value 40
              daily usage 2: service env 2, value 60
            * __2nd upload__ (same day, same usage type):
              daily usage 1: service env 1, value 50
            * __final result__:
              daily usage 1: service env 1, value 40
              daily usage 2: service env 2, value 60
              daily usage 3: service env 1, value 50

        And finally, here's an example request illustrating some of the concepts

        Team Time Divisions allow to allocate your team's working time (and

        been working on). The granularity of such allocations are per-month.

        There are a couple of important things to keep in mind here:
        * services given as uid-111/prod and uid-111/test are two different
        entities, despite the fact that they both share the same UID;
        * percents from the same division should sum up exactly to 100% - if
        you try to upload a division like 70+10+10 (or 70+10+10+20), you'll
        get a validation error.
        * when you upload two or more divisions for the same team and date
        (year+month), only the last one of them is taken into account (i.e.,
        it effectively overwrites previous ones);
        * your division requires at least one service_uid/environment/percent
        object to be present (in such case, its ``percent`` field should equal
        100.0);
        * this endpoint is only accessible to team managers. A team manager in
        Scrooge's is a person who is associated with a given team, and is
        allowed to allocate team resources (i.e. time) to services.

        This operation is provided for symmetry with POST (in case you'd need to
        check if Scrooge has correct divisions for your team - although you can
        look at this data via Scrooge's GUI as well) and it has the same form as
        POST minus ``payload`` part.

      summary: >-
        Fetch daily costs for given service/environment aggregated over given
        time period
      description: |
        You have to be owner of a given service if you want to be able to fetch the
        costs associated with it.

        The ``forecast`` field should be set to ``false`` in most cases - it triggers
        calculation of costs marked as "forecasted" instead of "normal" ones.

        If you omit ``types`` field, all pricing services are taken into
        account.

        Similarly with ``environment`` field - if you do not specify this, all
        costs from all environments associated with given service will be used
        for calculations.

        Setting ``accepted_only`` field to ``false`` will fetch costs that are
        not accepted. Please note that it's not possible to mix accepted and not
        accepted costs in a single request.

        Also, please note that when you set ``group_by`` to ``month``, the dates
        in ``date_from`` and ``date_to`` fields should be given as
        ``YYYY-MM-DD`` __not__ ``YYYY-MM``.

        The shape of response requires some attention here, because
        ``_pricing_service_symbol`` and ``_usage_type_symbol`` __are not__ the actual
        name of keys/properties - what you'll get here are the actual __symbols__, e.g.
        ``my_ps1_symbol``, ``my_ps2_symbol``, ``my_ut1_symbol``, and so on. The reason
        behind this is that ``Costs`` and ``SubCosts`` objects (see "Model" tab below),
        should be implemented as arrays of objects, not objects keyed by their symbol
        names.
